## Introduction

CN-Celeb, a large-scale Chinese celebrities dataset published by Center for Speech and Language Technology (CSLT) at Tsinghua University.

## Description

1. Collect audio data of 1,000 Chinese celebrities.

2. Automatically clip videos through a pipeline including face detection, face recognition, speaker validation and speaker diarization.

3. Create a benchmark database for speaker recognition community.

## Basic Methods

1. Environments: Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras, MxNet

2. Face detection and tracking: RetinaFace and ArcFace models.

3. Active speaker verification: SyncNet model.

4. Speaker diarization: UIS-RNN model.

5. Double check by speaker recognition: VGG model.

6. Input: pictures and videos of POIs (Persons of Interest).

7. Output: well-labelled videos of POIs (Persons of Interest).
